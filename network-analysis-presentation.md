# [fit] Network Analysis in Organizations
## Effectiveness & Leadership Potential Studies

---

# Overview

- Network analysis reveals hidden organizational dynamics
- Identifies informal leadership structures
- Predicts team effectiveness patterns
- Measures collaboration quality and knowledge flow

---

# What is Organizational Network Analysis?

> Network analysis maps relationships and interactions within organizations to understand:
> - Communication patterns
> - Influence networks  
> - Knowledge sharing pathways
> - Collaboration effectiveness

---

# Key Network Metrics

## **Centrality Measures**
- **Degree centrality**: Number of direct connections
- **Betweenness centrality**: Bridge between different groups
- **Closeness centrality**: Speed of information access
- **Eigenvector centrality**: Connections to well-connected people

---

# Leadership Potential Indicators

1. **High betweenness centrality** → Natural bridges and connectors
2. **Growing network reach** → Expanding influence over time
3. **Cross-functional connections** → Boundary spanning ability
4. **Information brokerage** → Access to diverse knowledge sources

---

# Network Patterns & Team Effectiveness

## Effective Networks Show:
- **Dense internal connections** within teams
- **Strategic external bridges** between departments
- **Redundant pathways** for critical information
- **Balanced centralization** (not too centralized or distributed)

---

# Data Collection Methods

```
Survey Approaches:
• "Who do you go to for advice?"
• "Who do you collaborate with regularly?"
• "Who influences your decisions?"

Digital Traces:
• Email communication patterns
• Collaboration tool usage
• Meeting attendance records
```
