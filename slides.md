# What is Organizational Network Analysis?

<div class="text-center mt-8">
<blockquote class="text-xl italic">
Network analysis maps relationships and interactions within organizations to understand:
</blockquote>
</div>

<v-clicks>

- **Communication patterns**
- **Influence networks**
- **Knowledge sharing pathways** 
- **Collaboration effectiveness**

</v-clicks>

# Key Network Metrics

## Centrality Measures

<v-clicks>

- **Degree centrality**: Number of direct connections
- **Betweenness centrality**: Bridge between different groups
- **Closeness centrality**: Speed of information access
- **Eigenvector centrality**: Connections to well-connected people

</v-clicks>

---

# Leadership Potential Indicators

<v-clicks>

1. **High betweenness centrality** → Natural bridges and connectors
2. **Growing network reach** → Expanding influence over time
3. **Cross-functional connections** → Boundary spanning ability
4. **Information brokerage** → Access to diverse knowledge sources

</v-clicks>

# Network Patterns & Team Effectiveness

## Effective Networks Show:

<v-clicks>

- **Dense internal connections** within teams
- **Strategic external bridges** between departments
- **Redundant pathways** for critical information
- **Balanced centralization** (not too centralized or distributed)

</v-clicks>
